# Overview
This is a simple sandbox to experiment with elasticsearch, springboot support of elastic, and other things 
related to elastic.  I decided to add rabbitmq in the mix because why not!  I'll use rabbitmq to send/receive
messages that will be persisted into elastic

#External setup
You will need to have rabbitmq (requires erlang) running.

TBD external elastic or use the springboot one?
